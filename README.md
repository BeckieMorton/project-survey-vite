# Survey Project

Week 6 - Technigo Web Development Bootcamp - Project Survey. This week, we practised React state and controlled forms by making a Typeform-like product. Our completed pair project consists of at 6 questions that need to be answered by users. When the user presses submit, they see a summary of their answers.

This project should be done in pairs. You will practice working in a dev team: <ins>Paired Project - Beckie Morton and Elin Olausson</ins>

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

<ins>Describe how you approached to problem</ins>: 

Learning content was less this week and concepts covered were not as difficult for us as last week. Now that we have expereince manipulating a react project and boilerplate we were able to start the project with little issues.

Code sessions and Q&A helped a lot and we are grateful for the code snippets that created next/back buttons.

The most difficult section was to get the survey to disappear and be replaced by the results section. We were able to solve this by using a hideQuiz variable which we put into the submitForm function inside SurveryForm.jsx.

<ins>How did you plan?</ins>: 
We drew a simple diagram for our parent to child structure.
We created a simple site design layout

<ins>What technologies did you use?</ins>:
HTML5
CSS3
React
Editor: VS Code

<ins>If you had more time, what would be next?</ins>: The results page needs a re-styling! It needs images to make it look like a "poster" as the site suggests.
WE would have also loved to have made it more user friendly for our target demographic (children aged 4-10), having clickable images (eg. on the favourite dinosaur page.
